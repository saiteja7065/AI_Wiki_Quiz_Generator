# DeepKlarity Technologies - AI Wiki Quiz Generator

# Objective

Build a **Frontend UI** and an **API in Python (FastAPI/Django)** that accepts a Wikipedia article URL as input and automatically generates a quiz based on the article content using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system should have two main tabs:

### TAB 1 - GENERATE QUIZ

1. **User Input:** User provides a Wikipedia article URL (e.g., `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing`).
2. **Backend Processing:**
    - Scrape the page content using a library such as **BeautifulSoup**.
    - Send the extracted text to an LLM (**Gemini free tier API** or any other free tier API via **LangChain**) to generate a quiz (5-10 questions).
    - The generated quiz output must contain:
        - Question text
        - Four options (A-D)
        - Correct answer
        - Short explanation
        - Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
        - Suggested related Wikipedia topics for further reading.
3. **Data Storage:** Store all scraped and generated data in a **MYSQL or POSTGRESQL** database.
4. **API Response:** The API should return **JSON** containing the extracted and generated information.
5. **Frontend Display:** The frontend should display this information neatly in a structured, card-based layout.

### TAB 2 - PAST QUIZZES (HISTORY)

1. Display a table listing all previously processed Wikipedia URLs stored in the database.
2. Clicking "**Details**" should open a modal displaying the full quiz in the same structured layout as Tab 1.

## Frontend Requirements

- Clean, minimal UI (React, Vue, or simple HTML acceptable).
- **Tab 1:** URL input field, "Generate Quiz" button, Structured display of quiz and related topics.
- **Tab 2:** Table of historical quizzes, "Details" modal (reused from Tab 1).
- **Optional:** Implement a "**Take Quiz**" mode (answers hidden until submitted).

## Technical Requirements

- **Backend:** FastAPI / Django
- **Database:** **MYSQL or POSTGRESQL**
- **Frontend:** React or minimal HTML
- **LLM:** Gemini or any free tier API via LangChain
- **Scraping:** BeautifulSoup
- **Data Source:** Wikipedia article URLs (HTML scraping only, **no Wikipedia API**).

NOTE: The use of Node.js for the backend or any core API functionality is strictly prohibited and will result in rejection. The backend must be implemented using Python (FastAPI/Django) as specified in the Technical Requirements.

## Sample API Output Structure

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "url": "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)",
  "title": "Alan Turing",
  "summary": "Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist...",
  "key_entities": {
    "people": ["Alan Turing", "Alonzo Church"],
    "organizations": ["University of Cambridge", "Bletchley Park"],
    "locations": ["United Kingdom"]
  },
  "sections": ["Early life", "World War II", "Legacy"],
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Where did Alan Turing study?",
      "options": [
        "Harvard University",
        "Cambridge University",
        "Oxford University",
        "Princeton University"
      ],
      "answer": "Cambridge University",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Mentioned in the 'Early life' section."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was Alan Turing's main contribution during World War II?",
      "options": [
        "Atomic research",
        "Breaking the Enigma code",
        "Inventing radar",
        "Developing jet engines"
      ],
      "answer": "Breaking the Enigma code",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Detailed in the 'World War II' section."
    }
  ],
  "related_topics": ["Cryptography", "Enigma machine", "Computer science history"]
}

```

## Submission Requirements

1. Complete working code for backend and frontend.
2. Screenshots of: Quiz generation page (Tab 1), History view (Tab 2), and Details modal.
3. `sample_data/` folder containing: Example Wikipedia URLs tested and Corresponding JSON API outputs.
4. `README` file explaining setup, endpoints, and testing steps.
5. Include the **LangChain prompt templates** used for quiz and related-topic generation.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Prompt Design & Optimization** | Effectiveness and clarity of prompts used for quiz generation, grounding of outputs in article content, and minimization of hallucination. |
| **Quiz Quality** | Relevance, diversity, factual correctness, and appropriate difficulty levels of generated questions. |
| **Extraction Quality** | Clean scraping and accurate extraction of key sections, summary, and entities. |
| **Functionality** | End-to-end flow: accepts URL, scrapes, generates quiz, and stores in database. |
| **Code Quality** | Modular, readable, and logically structured code with meaningful comments. |
| **Error Handling** | Handles invalid URLs, network errors, or missing sections gracefully. |
| **UI Design** | Clear, minimal, and visually organized layout; both tabs functional. |
| **Database Accuracy** | Data is correctly stored and retrievable in history view. |
| **Testing Evidence** | Sample data and screenshots demonstrate system robustness and variety. |

### Bonus Points

- "Take Quiz" mode with user scoring.
- URL validation and preview (auto-fetch article title before processing).
- Store scraped raw HTML in database for reference.
- Caching to prevent duplicate scraping of the same URL.
- Section-wise question grouping in UI.
